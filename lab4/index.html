			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Javascript</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to pseudocode an everyday task and a simple game.  We then had to covert the pseudocode into comments and put it in the javascript file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When we added the javascprit pseudocode comments into our html files, our comments looked a little funky.  we were able to fix it by changing how it was typed/formatted in the html file. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we put in just as much energy and effort as wel have in previous labs.  We brainstormed and worked together to acheieve an end result that we were both happy with.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
