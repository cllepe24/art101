            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The challenge of this lab was to write a function that would take user input.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I started out by adding a lot of unnecessary code that had lots of errors, thinking that I needed all of these extra parts.  However, once I looked at the source JS in the developer console, I deleted all of the unnecessary parts and stuck with the bits that I actually needed.  It took some trial and error, but I was able to fix my code to yield the desired result.</p>
