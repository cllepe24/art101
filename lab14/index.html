			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, I ran and debugged the previous labs.  I made sure the javascript ran correctly and edited it to make it look neater, and I added to the CSS to make the output look the way I wanted it to.</p>
			</div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>The only problem with this lab was that all of my previous labs didn't have javascript that needed to be fixed/debugged.</p>
            </div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My results are below</p>

                <h2>Debugging</h2>
                <p>None of my javascript needed to be changed, so I just made it neater abd changed some of the css on a couple.</p>
