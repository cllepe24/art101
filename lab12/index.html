			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The javascript wasn't running, which was really frustrating because I couldn't find any problems with the code or any typos. I ran the code on JSFiddle and it told me that there was a problem with the innerHTML (which I assumed was the innerHTML code I had in my Javascript). Upon comparing all of my code to the example code AND my partner's code, I found that I had linked the output/Javascript incorrectly, so I fixed it immediately and my issue was solved. Yay!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>With the help of my partner and the resources I had available, I managed to complete this lab without TOO much trouble.</p>
